FRITO-LAY NORTH AMERICA, INC. 
v. 
MEDALLION FOODS, INC. and RALCORP HOLDINGS, INC. 
Case No. 4:12-CV-74 
United States District Court EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS SHERMAN DIVISION 
Dated: March 30, 2012 
 
Judge Mazzant 
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER 
        Pending before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Or, In the Alternative, To Transfer to the 
Eastern District of Arkansas (Dkt. #16). Having considered the relevant pleadings, the Court is of the 
opinion that Defendants' motion should be denied. 
BACKGROUND1
 
 
        Medallion Foods, Inc. ("Medallion") is an Arkansas corporation with its principal place of business 
in Newport, Arkansas. It is a manufacturer of private-label food products, including corn-based snack 
foods. Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. ("Ralcorp") is a Missouri corporation with its principal place of business in 
St. Louis, Missouri. Ralcorp is a holding company, and is Medallion's parent company. 
        On February 8, 2012, Plaintiff sent a cease-and-desist letter to Defendants asserting that Defendants' 
product, BOWLZ, infringed Plaintiff's patent and trade dress rights as to its product TOSTITOS 
SCOOPS!. The letter gave Defendants until 12:00 noon on February 10, 2012, to comply. Defendants 
resisted Plaintiff's attempts at communication, and filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the Eastern 
District of Arkansas on February 10, 2012. Subsequently, Plaintiff 
Page 2 
filed its complaint in this Court on February 10, 2012 (Dkt. #1). 
        On March 20, 2012, Chief Judge J. Leon Holmes in the Eastern District of Arkansas denied 
Defendants' pending motion to enjoin Plaintiff from pursuing the action before this Court and granted in 
part Plaintiff's motion to dismiss the Arkansas action (Dkt. #35, Ex. A). Chief Judge Holmes stayed the 
Arkansas action pending this Court's ruling on personal jurisdiction and venue, and noted, "If the Eastern 
District of Texas decides that it has personal jurisdiction and denies the motion to transfer, the [Arkansas] 
action will be dismissed" (Dkt. #35, Ex. A at 5). 
        On February 22, 2012, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction Or, In the 
Alternative, to Transfer to the Eastern District of Arkansas (Dkt. #16). Plaintiff filed its Response in 
opposition on March 9, 2012 (Dkt. #31). On March 19, 2012, Defendants filed a Reply (Dkt. #33). On 
March 27, 2012, Plaintiff filed a Sur-Reply (Dkt. #37). 
LEGAL STANDARDS 
Personal Jurisdiction 
        In patent litigation, Federal Circuit law controls personal jurisdiction because the issue is "intimately 
involved in the substance of enforcement of the patent." QR Spex, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 507 F. Supp. 2d 
650, 655 (E.D. Tex. 2007) (citing Viam Corp. v. Iowa Export-Import Trading Co., 84 F.3d 424, 428 (Fed. 
Cir. 1996)); Patent Rights Prot. Grp., LLC v. Video Gaming Techs., Inc., 603 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 
2010) (citing Akro Corp. v. Luker, 45 F.3d 1541, 1543 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). "A federal court may exercise 
       - 2 - 
personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant only if (1) the long-arm statute creates personal jurisdiction 
over the foreign defendant, and (2) the exercise of personal jurisdiction over that defendant is consistent 
with the due process guarantees of the U.S. Constitution." Keranos, LLC v. Analog Devices, Inc., No. 
2:10-CV-207, 2011 WL 4027427, at *8 
Page 3 
(E.D. Tex. Sept. 12, 2011) (citing Patent Rights Prot. Grp., 603 F.3d at 1368-69). The Texas long-arm 
statute extends to the full extent permitted by the Due Process Clause. Religious Tech. Ctr. v. Liebreich, 
339 F.3d 369, 373 (5th Cir. 2003). 
        Thus, to establish that the Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants, Plaintiff must show that: 
(1) each Defendant has purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of the forum state by 
establishing minimum contacts with the forum state; and (2) the exercise of jurisdiction over each 
Defendant does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Int'l Shoe Co. v. 
Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316-20 (1945); Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474-77 
(1985). 
        After a non-resident defendant files a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, the burden 
of establishing the district court's jurisdiction lies with the party seeking to invoke the court's jurisdiction. 
Alpine View Co. Ltd. v. Atlas Copco AB, 205 F.3d 208, 215 (5th Cir. 2000). When, as here, no evidentiary 
hearing is conducted, "the party seeking to assert jurisdiction must present sufficient facts as to make out 
only a prima facie case supporting jurisdiction." Id. (citation omitted); see Graphic Controls Corp. v. 
Utah Medical Products, Inc., 149 F.3d 1382, 1383 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1998). When considering the motion to 
dismiss, the court must accept as true the plaintiff's uncontroverted allegations and resolve all factual 
disputes in favor of the plaintiff. Alpine View Co., 205 F.3d at 215 (citations omitted). 
        "Minimum contacts" can be established though contacts sufficient to support the exercise of either 
general or specific jurisdiction. Viam Corp., 84 F.3d at 428; J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 131 
S. Ct. 2780, 2787-88 (2011). General jurisdiction occurs when "a State exercises personal jurisdiction 
over a defendant in a suit not arising out of or related to the defendant's 
Page 4 
contacts with the forum . . ." Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414 n.9 
(1984). General jurisdiction exists only when the defendant's contacts with the State constitute 
"continuous and systematic" general contacts with the forum. Id. at 416. "Random, fortuitous, or 
attenuated contacts are not sufficient to establish general jurisdiction." Keranos, 2011 WL 4027427, at *9 
(citing Red Wing Shoe Co., Inc. v. Hockerson-Halberstadt, Inc., 148 F.3d 1355, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 1998)). 
        Specific jurisdiction exists where the plaintiff alleges a cause of action which grows out of or relates 
to a contact between the defendant and the forum state. Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 414 n.8; McIntyre, 131 
S. Ct. at 2787-88. "It is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully 
avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and 
protections of its laws." Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958). 
Motion to Transfer 
        A district court may transfer any civil case "for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the 
interest of justice...to any other district or division where it might have been brought." 28 U.S.C. ยง 
1404(a). The threshold inquiry when determining eligibility for transfer is "whether the judicial district to 
which transfer is sought would have been a district in which the claim could have been filed." In re 
Volkswagen AG, 371 F.3d 201, 203 (5th Cir. 2004) ("Volkswagen I"). 
       - 3 - 
        Once that threshold inquiry is met, the Court balances the private interests of the litigants and the 
public's interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice. In re Nintendo Co., Ltd., 589 F.3d 1194, 
1198 (Fed. Cir. 2009); In re TS Tech USA Corp, 551 F.3d 1315, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The private 
interest factors include (1) the relative ease of access to sources of proof; (2) the 
Page 5 
availability of compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses; (3) the cost of attendance for 
willing witnesses; (4) all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and 
inexpensive. In re Volkswagen of America, Inc., 545 F.3d 304, 315 (5th Cir. 2008) (en banc) 
("Volkswagen II"); In re Nintendo, 589 F.3d at 1198. The public interest factors include (1) the 
administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion; (2) the local interest in having localized 
interests decided at home; (3) the familiarity of the forum with the law that will govern the case; and (4) 
the avoidance of unnecessary problems of conflict of laws or in the application of foreign law. Id. These 
factors are not exhaustive or exclusive, and no single factor is dispositive. Id. 
        The party seeking transfer of venue must show good cause for the transfer. Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d 
at 315. The moving party must show that the transferee venue is "clearly more convenient" than the 
transferor venue. Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 315; TS Tech, 551 F.3d at 1319. The plaintiff's choice of 
venue is not a factor in this analysis, but rather contributes to the defendant's burden to show good cause 
for the transfer. Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 315 n.10; TS Tech, 551 F.3d at 1320; In re Nintendo, 589 F.3d 
at 1200. 
ANALYSIS 
Personal Jurisdiction 
        As stated above, Medallion is an Arkansas corporation with its principal place of business in 
Newport, Arkansas, and Ralcorp is a Missouri corporation with its principal place of business in St. 
Louis, Missouri. Defendants argue that neither Defendant is subject to general or specific jurisdiction in 
Texas. Defendants contend that there are no facts indicating either Defendant has the necessary 
"systematic and continuous" contacts required to subject them to general jurisdiction. Further, Defendants 
assert that they do not have any contacts in Texas related to the sale of the 
Page 6 
allegedly infringing tortilla chip products sufficient to subject them to specific jurisdiction. 
        Plaintiff asserts that Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction under the "stream of commerce" 
principle. Plaintiff contends that Medallion, controlled by Ralcorp, has fulfilled and continues to fulfill 
repeated purchase orders for the allegedly infringing chips for one of the nation's largest retailers, Wal-
Mart, that has hundreds of stores in Texas. Plaintiff argues that Defendants have an ongoing supplier 
relationship with Wal-Mart, which has a distribution system in place ensuring the allegedly infringing 
product reaches stores in Texas. Plaintiff contends that Defendants have full knowledge that the allegedly 
infringing tortilla chip product is sold in Texas. 
        The Supreme Court has held that the "forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due Process 
Clause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of 
commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State." World-
Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297-98 (1980); GSK Technologies, Inc. v. Schneider 
Electric, S.A., No. 6:06-CV-361, 2007 WL 788343, at *2 (E.D. Tex. March 14, 2007). Under the stream 
of commerce theory, "if the sale of a product of a manufacturer... is not simply an isolated occurrence, but 
arises from the efforts of the [defendant] to serve, directly, or indirectly, the market for its product..., 
       - 4 - 
[then] it is not unreasonable to subject [the defendant] to suit." World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 297. 
Subsequently, the Supreme Court revisited the issues of personal jurisdiction under the stream of 
commerce theory in Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cnty., 480 U.S. 102 (1987), 
but the Court was fractured on the proper approach. "A plurality opinion by Justice O'Connor [in Asahi] 
advocated a requirement of additional conduct by the defendant to support personal jurisdiction under the 
stream of commerce theory." Ruston Gas Turbines, Inc. v. Donaldson Co., 9 F.3d 415, 419 (5th Cir. 
1993) (internal 
Page 7 
quotations omitted); Icon Health & Fitness, Inc. v. Horizon Fitness, Inc., No. 5:08-CV-26, 2009 WL 
1025467, at *8 (E.D. Tex. March 26, 2009). However, Justice Brennan, writing on behalf of three 
justices, stated that, "Mere placement in the stream of commerce is sufficient because 'as long as a 
participant in this process is aware that the final product is being marketed in the forum State, the 
possibility of a lawsuit there cannot come as a surprise." Icon Health, 2009 WL 1025467, at *8 (citing 
Asahi, 480 U.S. at 117). 
        "The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has not expressly decided whether Justice Brennan's view is 
sufficient to establish minimum contacts because it has 'yet to be presented with facts that do not meet the 
more rigorous standard adopted by Justice O'Connor.'" Icon Health, 2009 WL 1025467, at *8 (citing 
Commissariat A L'Energie Atomique, 395 F.3d 1315, 1322 n.7 (Fed. Cir. 2005)). 
        Defendants argue that the Supreme Court "recently revisited the proper due process standard for 
personal jurisdiction on a stream of commerce theory in McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 131 S.Ct. 
2780 (2011)." REPLY at 2. Defendants contend that the Supreme Court rejected the foreseeability 
analysis, and made it clear that "the defendant's transmission of goods permits the exercise of jurisdiction 
only where the defendant can be said to have targeted the forum; as a general rule, it is not enough that 
the defendant might have predicted that its goods will reach the forum State." REPLY at 3 (citing 
McIntyre, 131 S. Ct. at 2788). 
        However, as other courts in this district have also found, the plurality opinion in McIntyre, written by 
Justice Kennedy, is not the precedential holding of the Supreme Court. Brooks & Baker, LLC v. 
Flambeau, No. 2:10-CV-146, 2011 WL 4591905, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 30, 2011); Dram Technologies, 
LLC v. America II Group, Inc., No. 2:10-CV-45, 2011 WL 4591902, at *2 (E.D. Tex. 
Page 8 
Sept. 30, 2011). "When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result 
enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those 
Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds." Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 
188, 193 (1977). Therefore, Justice Breyer's concurrence is the controlling opinion of the Supreme Court. 
Justice Breyer specifically declined to announce a new rule in stream of commerce cases, and stated: 
"Accordingly, on the record present here, resolving this case requires no more than adhering to our 
precedents." McIntyre, 131 S. Ct. at 2792. Further, the plurality opinion in McIntyre focused on three 
facts to determine whether personal jurisdiction was appropriate: (1) the distributor sold and shipped a 
machine on one occasion to a customer of the forum state; (2) the manufacturer wanted the distributor to 
sell its machines to anyone in the United States; and (3) representatives of the manufacturer attended trade 
shows in the United States, but not in the forum State. Id. at 2791. The plurality concluded that there were 
insufficient facts to determine that the defendant purposefully availed itself of the forum State's market. 
        The facts in the present case indicate a much stronger reason for the Court to hold that personal 
jurisdiction is proper in Texas. Medallion manufactures the allegedly infringing tortilla chips. Medallion 
       - 5 - 
has fulfilled and continues to fulfill repeated purchase orders for the allegedly infringing tortilla chips for 
Wal-Mart, a "major customer" of Defendants. Medallion knows that these allegedly infringing tortilla 
chips are then sold in Texas, and Medallion continues to reap the benefit of the sales of the tortilla chips 
in Texas. As the Federal Circuit found in a similar case, "[they] placed the accused [products] in the 
stream of commerce, they knew the likely destination of the products, and their conduct and connections 
with the forum state were such that they should reasonably have anticipated being brought into court 
there." Beverly Hills Fan Co. v. Royal 
Page 9 
Sovereign Corp., 21 F.3d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1994); see also Icon Health, 2009 WL 1025467, at Dram 
Technologies, 2011 WL 4591902, at *3. The Federal Circuit went on to state that "the defendants' 
shipments into [the forum state] were purposeful or knowing as evidenced by the defendants' commercial 
relationship with [a forum state retailer that] was ongoing, and obviously intentional." Icon Health, 2009 
WL 1025467, at *11 (citing Beverly Hills Fan, 21 F.3d at 1564). The Court finds that personal 
jurisdiction in the Eastern District of Texas is proper as to Medallion based on these facts. 
        Defendants contend that Ralcorp has no connection to the sales of allegedly infringing tortilla chips 
in Texas, since it is merely Medallion's parent holding company. Defendants further argue that there are 
no facts which would justify piercing the corporate veil to establish jurisdiction over Ralcorp through the 
activities of Medallion. Plaintiff asserts that Ralcorp and Medallion are part of a unitary business 
operation. Ralcorp filed suit with Medallion in the Eastern District of Arkansas, and admitted its 
involvement in making the allegedly infringing tortilla chip product. In addition, Plaintiff contends that 
Ralcorp exercises control over and participates fully in its subsidiaries' operations. On Ralcorp's website, 
Medallion is described as a "division of Ralcorp." Further, Plaintiff notes that an employment opportunity 
in Newport, Arkansas, presumably at the Medallion plant, is described as a job with Ralcorp Snacks, 
Sauces & Spreads, not with Medallion. Ralcorp and Medallion share common officers. Defendants do not 
controvert any of these facts asserted by Plaintiff. Ralcorp merely contends that it does not manufacture 
the allegedly infringing tortilla chip product. 
        Taking Plaintiff's allegations as true, which the Court must do in this case, and the evidence 
presented by the Plaintiff, the Court finds that Ralcorp and Medallion identify themselves 
Page 10 
interchangeably on Ralcorp's website. Medallion is described as "combined into a single operating unit in 
2008 to leverage sales and marketing opportunities." The two companies share some corporate officers, 
and an employment opportunity at a Medallion plant is considered employment with Ralcorp. Finally, the 
companies sued Plaintiff together in the Eastern District of Arkansas, jointly seeking a declaration of their 
rights to the allegedly infringing tortilla chip product. Given these facts presented by Plaintiff, the Court 
finds that Ralcorp and Medallion have sufficient minimum contacts with the State of Texas to justify 
subjecting them to personal jurisdiction. See GSK Techs., 2007 WL 788343, at *3; Cardsoft, Inc. v. 
Verifone Holdings, Inc., No. 2-08-CV-098, 2009 WL 361069, at *1-2 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 10, 2009). 
        The Court also finds that the claim arises out of or relates to Defendants' contacts with the State of 
Texas, since the claims all arise from the manufacture and sale of the allegedly infringing tortilla chip 
products. Finally, the Court finds that the exercise of jurisdiction over the Defendants does not offend 
traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Motion to Transfer2
 
 
        Defendants argue that the proper and more convenient venue for this litigation is the Northern 
Division of the Eastern District of Arkansas. Plaintiff contends that the Eastern District of Texas, 
Sherman Division, is proper, and that Defendants have not met their burden to show that the Eastern 
       - 6 - 
District of Arkansas is clearly a more convenient forum for this litigation. The first question the Court 
must address when ruling on a motion to transfer venue under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a) is whether the suit 
could have been filed originally in the destination venue. Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 312. 
Page 11 
The parties do not dispute that this case could have been filed in the Eastern District of Arkansas. 
        The Court must review a number of private and public factors with regard to convenience on a 
motion to transfer venue. Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 315; TS Tech, 551 F.3d at 1319. 
A. Private Interest Factors 
        (1) The Relative Ease of Access to Sources of Proof 
        "Courts analyze this factor in light of the distance that documents, or other evidence must be 
transported from their existing location to the trial venue." On Semiconductor Corp. v. Hynix 
Semiconductor, Inc., No. 6:09-CV-390, 2010 WL 3855520, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 30, 2010) (citing 
Volkswagon II, 545 F.3d at 316). This factor will rely on which party has a greater volume of documents 
relevant to the litigation, and their presumed location in relation to the transferee and transferor venues. 
Id. (citations omitted). Documents that have been moved in anticipation of litigation should not be 
considered. In re Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., 587 F.3d 1333, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 
        Defendants assert that, "the bulk of the documentary evidence concerning the allegedly infringing 
product is located at Medallion's production facility in Newport, Arkansas." MOTION at 18. Defendants 
also assert that Wal-Mart will be a necessary source of evidence with respect to the alleged infringement 
of Plaintiff's trademarks and trade dress. Id. Defendants contend that the Northern Division of the Eastern 
District of Arkansas is located approximately 30 miles from Medallion's production facility, and 200 
miles from Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, whereas the Eastern District of Texas is located 
approximately 300 miles from Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville. Finally, Defendants argue that the 
allegedly infringing machines themselves are located in Arkansas. REPLY at 9. 
Page 12 
        Plaintiff contends that the location of the evidence does not weigh in favor of transfer because 
evidence related to "documents and witnesses, including persons with knowledge about the research and 
development, marketing, branding strategies, the effects of Defendants' deliberate knock-off product, and 
finances related to the TOSTITOS SCOOPS!," are located in the Eastern District of Texas. SUR-REPLY 
at 8. Plaintiff argues that the patent inventors are located in the Eastern District of Texas. Plaintiff 
contends that Defendants fail to show why evidence from Wal-Mart will be required in this case, since 
Medallion manufactures the allegedly infringing chips. SUR-REPLY at 9. Finally, Plaintiff argues that 
there may be relevant evidence obtained from Ralcorp, which is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. 
RESPONSE at 21. 
        "[T]his factor almost invariably turns on which party will most likely have the greater volume of 
relevant documents and their presumed physical location in relation to the venues under consideration." 
Remmers v. U.S., No. 1:09-CV-345, 2009 WL 3617597, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Oct. 28, 2009) (citing Fujitsu 
Ltd. v. Tellabs, Inc., 639 F. Supp. 2d 761, 767 (E.D. Tex. 2009)). "In patent infringement cases, the bulk 
of the relevant evidence usually comes from the accused infringer. Consequently, the place where the 
defendant's documents are kept weighs in favor of transfer to that location." In re Genentech, 566 F.3d 
1338, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (internal quotations omitted). However, because the sources of proof 
originate from varied locations, this factor is neutral. An action in the Eastern District of Arkansas is not 
"clearly more convenient" for transporting documents that are located in the Eastern District of Texas and 
       - 7 - 
potentially Missouri. See, e.g., Konami Dig. Ent. Co. Ltd. v. Harmonix Music Sys., No. 6:08-CV-286-
LED-JEL, 2009 WL 781134, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 23, 2009) ("While Defendants point to [the transferee 
district] as the location of significant sources of proof, they ignore the remaining sources of proof which 
originate from other 
Page 13 
locations."); Perritt v. Jenkins, No. 4:11-CV-23-MHS-ALM, 2011 WL 3511468, at *3 (E.D. Tex. July 18, 
2011) ("Because the sources of proof originate from varied locations, this factor is neutral."). Further, "a 
case should not be transferred if the only practical effect is to shift inconvenience from the moving party 
to the nonmoving party." Goodman Co. v. A & H Supply, Inc., 396 F. Supp. 2d 766, 776 (S.D. Tex. 2005). 
Therefore, the Court finds this factor is neutral. 
        (2) The Availability of Compulsory Process 
        Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(b)(2) allows a federal court to compel a witness' attendance at a 
trial or hearing by subpoena; however, the Court's subpoena power is limited by Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 45(c)(3), to those witnesses who work or reside less than 100 miles from the courthouse. See 
Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 316. 
        Defendants contend that numerous Wal-Mart employees, who will be necessary witnesses with 
respect to the trademark issues in this case, will be outside the subpoena power of this Court since they 
will have to travel (1) more than 100 miles and (2) from another state. MOTION at 19. 
        Plaintiff argues that Defendants have not shown why they will need testimony from Wal-Mart 
employees, when Medallion is the manufacturer of the allegedly infringing chips. SUR-REPLY at 9. 
Plaintiff asserts that it does not anticipate significant documents or testimony from Wal-Mart or its 
employees, especially since they are not a party to this action. Id. Finally, Plaintiff contends that the 
inventors are also non-party witnesses who are located in the Eastern District of Texas. 
        The Court finds that this factor is also neutral. Defendants have not identified how many witnesses 
or what type of evidence they will need to obtain from these witnesses employed by Wal-Mart. In 
addition, it is unclear whether these same employee witnesses will be under the subpoena power of the 
Eastern District of Arkansas or not. Further, Plaintiff indicates that the inventors of the 
Page 14 
patents are located in the Eastern District of Texas. Therefore, this factor is neutral. 
        (3) Cost of Attendance for Willing Witnesses 
        The Fifth Circuit established the "100-mile" rule to determine the convenience of the transferee 
district to the witnesses and parties. "When the distance between an existing venue for trial of a matter 
and a proposed venue under ยง 1404(a) is more than 100 miles, the factor of the convenience to witnesses 
increases in direct relationship to the additional distance to be traveled." Volkswagen I, 371 F.3d at 204-
05. Where witnesses are from widely scattered locations, a trial court should not consider its "central 
location... in the absence of witnesses within the plaintiff's choice of venue." Genentech, 566 F.3d at 
1344. 
        "In considering the availability and convenience of witnesses, a court must concentrate primarily 
upon the availability and convenience of key witnesses." Remmers, 2009 WL 3617597, at *5; Shoemake 
v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., 233 F. Supp. 2d 828, 832 (E.D. Tex. 2002). Moreover, it is the convenience of 
non-party witnesses, rather than of party witnesses, that is more important and accorded greater weight in 
       - 8 - 
a transfer of venue analysis. Shoemake, 233 F. Supp. 2d at 832. Again, Defendants' party and non-party 
witnesses are located in Arkansas and Missouri, and Plaintiff's party and non-party witnesses are located 
in the Eastern District of Texas. Defendants have identified no specific witnesses that will be required to 
testify on their behalf. Further, the Plaintiff's evidence indicates that, at least for Wal-Mart employees in 
Bentonville, the distance to the courthouse in Sherman is only approximately 30 extra minutes. Therefore, 
the Court finds this factor is also neutral.

        Plaintiff argues that the patent rules of the Eastern District of Texas help streamline the parties' 
preparation for trial, which makes this factor weigh against transfer. Defendants argue that this case is 
primarily a trademark case, based on Plaintiff's intent to move for a preliminary injunction based on the 
trademark, trade dress, and unfair competition issues. Therefore, Defendants argue that the fact that the 
Eastern District of Arkansas does not have patent rules should not weigh against transfer. 
        The Court finds that this factor does not support transfer. See EMG Tech., LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 
No. 6:09-CV-367, 2010 WL 3835768, at *5 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 28, 2010). 
        b. Plaintiff's Choice of Forum 
        "While not a distinct factor in the transfer of venue analysis, a plaintiff's choice of venue 'is 
nonetheless taken into account as it places a significant burden on the movant to show good cause for the 
transfer.'" Remmers, 2009 WL 3617597, at *7 (citing Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 314 n.10). "This 'good 
cause' burden reflects the appropriate deference to which the plaintiff's choice of venue is entitled." Id. 
(citing Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 315). "If the defendant cannot meet this burden, the plaintiff's choice of 
forum should be respected." BlueEarth Biofuels, LLC v. Hawaiian Elec. Co., Inc., No. 3:08-CV-1779-L, 
2009 WL 918459, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 3, 2009) (citing Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 315). However, 
"[w]hen the chosen district has little or no factual nexus to the case, the plaintiff's choice of forum is less 
significant if other factors weigh in favor of a transfer." Remmers, 2009 WL 3617597, at *7 (citing 
Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d at 315-18). 
        In the present case, the Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division, has a clear factual nexus 
Page 16 
to the case given that Plaintiff is located here, and the patented technology was developed here. 
Therefore, the Court finds that Defendants must meet their burden to show good cause for the transfer, 
and if they cannot, Plaintiff's choice of venue will be respected. 
B. Public Interest Factors 
        (1) The Administrative Difficulties Flowing From Court Congestion 
        The first public interest factor is court congestion. Generally, this factor favors a district that can 
bring a case to trial faster. In re Genentech, 566 F.3d at 1347. This factor appears to be the most 
speculative and this factor alone should not outweigh other factors. Id. 
        Plaintiffs contend that "[i]n the Eastern District of Arkansas in 2011, there were 1,864 pending cases 
per judge, compared with just 488 cases per judge in the Eastern District of Texas." RESPONSE at 24. 
       - 9 - 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's statistics do not consider the recent retirements and administrative 
redistribution of cases in this Court. REPLY at 9. 
        The Court finds that this factor weighs slightly against transfer. 
        (2) The Local Interest in Having Localized Interests Decided at Home 
        Traditionally, the location of the alleged injury is an important consideration in determining how to 
weigh this factor. TS Tech, 551 F.3d at 1321. However, in a patent infringement case, when the accused 
products are sold nationwide, the alleged injury does not create a substantial local interest in any 
particular district. Id. Local interest may also be determined when a district is home to a party because the 
suit may call into question the reputation of individuals that work and conduct business in the community. 
Hoffman-La Roche, 587 F.3d at 1336. 
        Defendants argue that Arkansas has a strong interest in the interests of its corporations, processes, 
factory workers, and products made in Arkansas. Defendants also argue that any 
Page 17 
injunction will affect Arkansas-based Wal-Mart. However, Defendants also contend that the Eastern 
District of Texas has no factual connection to the case, which is not entirely true. The allegedly infringing 
products are sold in the Eastern District of Texas, and the patented technology was developed in the 
Eastern District of Texas. Therefore, the Court finds that this factor is neutral, since both districts have an 
interest in the outcome of the case. 
        (3) The Familiarity of the Forum with the Law that Will Govern the Case 
        This case is an action arising under federal law. Therefore, this factor is neutral as to transfer. 
        (4) The Avoidance of Unnecessary Problems of Conflict of Laws 
        There are no conflict of law concerns in this case. This factor is neutral as to transfer. 
C. Conclusion 
        The Court finds that six (6) of the private and public interest factors are neutral, and two (2) factors 
weigh slightly against transfer. Therefore, the Court finds that Defendants have not satisfied their burden 
to show that the Eastern District of Arkansas is a "clearly more convenient" forum for this litigation. 
CONCLUSION 
        For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Or, In the Alternative, 
To Transfer to the Eastern District of Arkansas (Dkt. #16) is DENIED. 
        IT IS SO ORDERED.

        1. All background facts are taken from Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Or, In the Alternative, to Transfer to the 
Eastern District of Arkansas (Dkt. #16), and Plaintiff's Response (Dkt. #31). 
        2.The Court will not address the arguments regarding transfer based on the "first-to-file rule," since that 
argument was ruled on by the Eastern District of Arkansas and is now moot. Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. v. Frito-Lay 
North America, Inc., No. 1:12-CV-00018 JLH (E.D. Arkansas March 20, 2012) (Holmes, J.).
