BACKGROUND FACTS 
11. Ronald A. Katz ("Mr. Katz"), founder of Katz Technology Licensing, is the sole 
inventor of each of the patents in suit. Mr. Katz has been widely recognized as one of the most 
prolific and successful inventors of our time, and his inventions over the last forty-plus years 
have been utilized by literally millions of people. 
12. In 1961, Mr. Katz co-founded Telecredit Inc. ("Telecredit"), the first company to 
provide online, real-time credit authorization, allowing merchants to verify checks over the 
telephone. Further innovations from Telecredit include the first online, real-time, point-of-sale 
credit verification terminal, which enabled merchants to verify checks without requiring the 
assistance of a live operator, and the first device that used and updated magnetically-encoded 
505993 v2/SD 3 
Case 5:06-cv-00187-DF   Document 1    Filed 08/21/06   Page 4 of 13 PageID #:  4
cards in automated teller machines. Multiple patents issued from these innovations, including 
patents co-invented by Mr. Katz. 
13.. Mr .. Katz's inventions have not been limited to telephonic check verification .. 
Indeed, Mr. Katz is responsible for advancements in many fields of technology. Among his most 
prominent and well-known innovations are those in the field of interactive call processing .. Mr. 
Katz's inventions in that field are directed to the integration of telephonic systems with computer 
databases and live operator call centers to provide interactive call processing services .. 
14.. The first of Mr. Katz's interactive call processing patents issued on December 20, 
1988. More than fifty U.S. patents have issued to Mr. Katz for his inventions in the interactive 
call processing field, including the patents-in-suit which are in the particular field of multiple 
party telephone conferencing systems. 
15. In 1988, Mr. Katz partnered with American Express to establish FDR Interactive 
Technologies, later renamed Call Interactive, to provide interactive call processing services 
based on Mr .. Katz's inventions. The American Express business unit involved in this joint 
venture later became known as First Data. 
16. Mr. Katz sold his interest in Call Interactive to American Express in 1989 but 
continued to provide advisory services to Call Interactive until 1992. American Express later 
spun off the First Data business unit into a separate corporation, and with that new entity went 
Mr. Katz's interactive call processing patents and the Call Interactive call processing business. 
The former Call Interactive, now known as First Data Voice Services, continues to provide call 
processing solutions today. 
17.. In 1994, Mr. Katz formed Katz Technology Licensing, which acquired the rights 
to the entire interactive call processing patent portfolio, including the rights to each of the 
505993 v2/SD 4 
Case 5:06-cv-00187-DF   Document 1    Filed 08/21/06   Page 5 of 13 PageID #:  5
patents-in-suit (with the exception of U.S. Patent No. 6,157,711, which issued on December 5, 
2000, with Katz Technology Licensing as assignee), from First Data, the owner of all of the Katz 
interactive call processing patents at that time. 
18. The marketplace has clearly recognized the value of Mr. Katz's inventions .. 
Indeed, over 100 companies, including in some instances direct competitors of the defendants, 
have licensed the patents-in-suit. Licensees include IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Bank of America, 
JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, HSBC, AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Microsoft, Delta Airlines, 
Merck, Sears, and Home Shopping Network. 
19.. Each of the defendants employs the inventions of certain of the patents-in-suit. 
Katz Technology Licensing, through its licensing arm A2D, L.P., has repeatedly attempted to 
engage each defendant in licensing negotiations, but to date, none of the defendants have agreed 
to take a license to any of the patents-in-suit.
