JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
5. This is an action for infringement of a United States patent arising under 35 
U.S.C. §§ 271, 281, and 284–85, among others.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction of the 
action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § 1338(a). 
6. In the Razer USA action, Razer USA supported its Reply to its Motion to Dismiss 
for Improper Venue with a declaration from Lionel Ser.  (Dkt. 22-1.)  Mr. Ser is a Senior Patent 
Counsel at Razer AP.  (Id. at ¶ 1.)  Razer AP has been actively involved in Razer USA’s defense 
in the Razer USA action. 
7. Razer AP owns the website RAZERZONE.COM.  Razer AP created this website 
on April 15, 1999, and has owned it ever since.   
8. Razer AP has sold computer mice through its website RAZERZONE.COM to 
customers in this District and elsewhere in Texas.    
9. Razer AP has directed Razer USA’s marketing and sale of computer mice in the 
United States. 
10. Razer AP has imported computer mice into the United States, with Razer USA as 
the receiver for these shipments.   
11. Razer has operated a research and development laboratory in Cedar Park, Texas. 
That laboratory is located at 1460 E. Whitestone Blvd. #101, Cedar Park, TX 78613, property 
which is owned by Razer USA.   
12. Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)(3) because Razer AP is 
Singaporean company not resident in the United States.  See Brunette Machine Works v. Kockum 
Indus., 406 U.S. 706 (1972).

13. Razer AP is subject to this Court’s specific and general personal jurisdiction 
under due process and/or the Texas Long Arm Statute due at least to Razer AP’s substantial 
business in this forum, including: (i) at least a portion of the infringements alleged herein; and 
(ii) regularly doing or soliciting business, engaging in other persistent courses of conduct, and/or 
deriving substantial revenue from goods and services provided to individuals in this District and 
elsewhere in Texas. 
THE TECHNOLOGY 
14. The patent-in-suit, U.S. Patent No. 7,532,200 (“the ‘200 Patent”), titled 
“Apparatus for Setting Multi-Stage Displacement Resolution of a Mouse,” teaches a device 
capable of setting the resolution for a computer mouse, often measured in “dots-per-inch” (DPI). 
The resolution determines how much the mouse cursor moves on a computer screen for each 
corresponding movement of the mouse itself by the user. For example, if the DPI ratio is 1:1, the 
cursor moves one “dot” on the screen per inch of motion by the mouse. Depending on an 
individual user’s needs, that ratio (resolution) can be adjusted to provide the user with a 
customized experience. For example, a user playing computer games may wish for more precise 
control of the cursor and adjust the resolution so that each movement on the screen requires a 
larger movement of the mouse itself.  
15. In the prior art, adjusting the resolution generally required installing a software 
driver on a connected computer, and changing the resolution within that software program. The 
user first needed to install the software, which required a separate item such as a CD-ROM. 
Next, the user needed to locate the installed software on the computer and then determine how to 
adjust the desired parameter within the software. In contrast, the inventor of the technology 
described in the ‘200 Patent developed a mouse that includes a button and/or switch on the 
Case 2:17-cv-00634-JRG   Document 1   Filed 09/07/17   Page 3 of 11 PageID #:  3

mouse for adjusting the resolution by hand to generate a resolution value, without using a 
software driver or tool that is external to the mouse. Among other advantages, this approach 
allows the user to directly adjust the mouse’s resolution quickly and easily, without using a 
software driver or tool on the connected computer. 
COUNT I: DIRECT INFRINGEMENT OF U.S. PATENT NO. 7,532,200 
16. On May 12, 2009, the ‘200 Patent was duly and legally issued by the United 
States Patent and Trademark Office. 
17. Better Mouse is the owner of the ‘200 Patent with all substantive rights in and to 
that patent, including the sole and exclusive right to prosecute this action and enforce the ‘200 
Patent against infringers, and to collect damages for all relevant times.  
18. Razer AP made, had made, used, imported, provided, supplied, distributed, sold, 
and/or offered for sale computer mice and other devices (“the accused products”), including, for 
example, at least the Abyssus Mirror, Orochi 2013, and Ouroboros mice, which infringe one or 
more claims of the ‘200 Patent.

19. The accused products also include the mice identified in Better Mouse’s 
infringement contentions against Razer USA.  
20. By doing so, Razer AP has directly infringed (literally and/or under the doctrine 
of equivalents) at least Claim 6 of the ‘200 Patent. Razer AP’s infringement in this regard is 
ongoing.  
21. Razer AP has infringed the ‘200 Patent by making, having made, using, 
importing, providing, supplying, distributing, selling or offering for sale systems that comprise 
an apparatus for setting multi-stage displacement resolution of a mouse. 
22. The accused products include an X-Y axis plane displacement detector, for 
sensing a distance and a moving direction generated by the mouse in a two-dimensional space. 
23. The accused products include an N-stage switch for setting a resolution value, the 
N-stage switch circuit having a switching button capable of being manually switched to one of 
positions 1 to N, and accordingly activating a connected resolution setting pin to indicate a state, 
where N is a positive integer. 
24. The accused products include a mouse micro controller with a register, coupled to 
the X-Y axis plane displacement detector and the switching circuit, the mouse micro controller 
determining the resolution value based on the state of the connected resolution setting pins. 
25. The accused products include setting a mouse resolution based on the resolution 
value and storing the resolution value in the register. 
26. The accused products include the mouse micro controller responding to the 
distance and moving direction sensed by the X-Y axis plane displacement detector to provide a 
control signal to a computer connected to the mouse, thereby moving the mouse cursor on a 
Case 2:17-cv-00634-JRG   Document 1   Filed 09/07/17   Page 8 of 11 PageID #:  8

screen of the computer, the mouse cursor being moved directly based on the resolution value 
stored in the register. 
27. Better Mouse has been damaged as a result of the infringing conduct by Razer 
USA alleged above.  Thus, Razer USA is liable to Better Mouse in an amount that adequately 
compensates Better Mouse for such infringements, which, by law, cannot be less than a 
reasonable royalty, together with interest and costs as fixed by this Court under 35 U.S.C. § 284. 
28. Better Mouse and/or its predecessors-in-interest have satisfied all statutory 
obligations required to collect pre-filing damages for the full period allowed by law for 
infringement of the ‘200 Patent. 
JURY DEMAND 
 Better Mouse hereby requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable by right. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
Better Mouse requests that the Court find in its favor and against Defendant, and that the 
Court grant Better Mouse the following relief: 
a. Judgment that one or more claims of the ‘200 Patent have been infringed, either 
literally and/or under the doctrine of equivalents, by Defendant and/or all others acting in concert 
therewith; 
b. A permanent injunction enjoining Defendant and its officers, directors, agents, 
servants, affiliates, employees, divisions, branches, subsidiaries, parents, and all others acting in 
concert therewith from infringement of the ‘200 Patent; or, in the alternative, an award of a 
reasonable ongoing royalty for future infringement of the ‘200 Patent by such entities; 
c. Judgment that Defendant account for and pay to Better Mouse all damages to and 
costs incurred by Better Mouse because of Defendant’s infringing activities and other conduct

complained of herein, including an award of all increased damages to which Better Mouse is 
entitled under 35 U.S.C. § 284; 
d. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on the damages caused by Defendant’s 
infringing activities and other conduct complained of herein; 
e. A declaration by the Court that this an exceptional case and an award to Better 
Mouse its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs in accordance with 35 U.S.C. § 285; and 
f. Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper under the 
circumstances.
