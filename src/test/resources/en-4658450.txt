BACKGROUND 
The Invention 
8. Keith A. Lowery is the inventor of the U.S. Patent No. 6,446,111 (“the ’111 
Patent”). The ’111 Patent resulted from the pioneering research of Mr. Lowery in the area of 
website scalability and  how websites could more efficiently and quickly process very large 
volumes of website visitor requests for web pages.  Mr. Lowery’s research resulted in the 
Case 4:17-cv-00878-ALM-KPJ   Document 1   Filed 12/20/17   Page 2 of 16 PageID #:  2
Page 3 of 16 
 
development of a method and apparatus for client-server communication involving a 
dynamically generated, transient applet in the late-1990s.  At the time of Mr. Lowery’s research, 
the most widely implemented website technology used to process  requests for web pages was 
client-server architecture.  In that type of system, when website visitors’ requests for web pages 
were received, websites would process those requests on the website’s page servers and then 
return the requested web page to the client. Mr. Lowery conceived of the inventions claimed in 
the ‘111 Patent as a way to off-load the processing of requests for web pages from the website’s 
page servers to the client’s computers through the use of dynamically generated applets.         
9. For example, Mr. Lowery developed a method of processing data comprising, 
receiving a data request from a client device at a server system over a communications link; 
collecting on the server a plurality of data items in response to the data request; generating an 
executable applet dynamically in response to the data request, a constituent system associated 
with the applet including a subset of the data items therein as pre-loaded values; wherein a 
further constituent system associated with the executable applet comprises a data interface 
capability configured to provide a plurality of operations on the pre-loaded values, the operations 
comprising operations associated with the subset of the data items; and transferring the applet to 
the client device.

Advantage Over the Prior Art 
13. The patented invention  disclosed in the ‘111 Patent, provides many advantages 
over the prior art, and in particular improved the operations of computers and computer 
networks. See ’111 Patent at col. 2, ll. 55 – col. 3, ll. 22. One advantage of the patented invention 
Case 4:17-cv-00878-ALM-KPJ   Document 1   Filed 12/20/17   Page 6 of 16 PageID #:  6
Page 7 of 16 
 
is that it allows for the decrease of the total amount of data transferred between a client and a 
server thus allowing for increased speed and efficiency. See ’111 Patent at col. 3, ll. 11-17.  
14. Another advantage of the patented invention is that it allows the client using a 
computing device that has limited storage capabilities to initiate and complete the transaction 
without having to load and store a variety of support programs that may be required by the 
server. See ’111 Patent at col. 2, ll. 67 – col. 3, ll. 5.  
15. Another advantage of the patented invention is that resources of the client device 
can be freed by discarding the applet after the transaction. See ’111 Patent at col. 3, ll. 6-10.  
16. Yet another advantage of the patented invention is the efficiency created by the 
avoidance of transmitting duplicate data. See ’111 Patent at col. 3, ll. 17-23.  
17. Because of these significant advantages that can be achieved through the use of 
the patented invention, DYNAMIC believes that the ’111 Patent is widely implemented. Indeed, 
the patented invention can be used for a variety of websites in many diverse businesses, 
including movie, clothing, automobiles, and general and specialty retailers along with entities 
providing services such as banking, auction, design, travel, and entertainment services. 
Technological Innovation 
18. The patented invention disclosed in the ‘111 Patent resolves technical problems 
related to the transmission of information between a server and client, particularly problems 
related to the utilization of web page software on client devices connected to web servers.  As the 
‘111 Patent explains, one of the limitations of the prior art as regards the transmission of 
information was that many applications required multiple, data-intensive transfers of information 
between the server and the client device. See ’111 patent, cols. 1-2.  
Case 4:17-cv-00878-ALM-KPJ   Document 1   Filed 12/20/17   Page 7 of 16 PageID #:  7
Page 8 of 16 
 
19. The claims of the ‘111 Patent do not merely recite the performance of some well-
known business practice from the pre-Internet world along with the requirement to perform it on 
the Internet.  Instead, the claims of the ‘111 Patent recite inventive concepts that are deeply 
rooted in computer technology, and overcome problems specifically arising  out of how to more 
quickly and efficiently scale websites to handle very large volumes of requests for web pages 
through the creation and implementation of dynamically generated applets. 
20. In addition, the claims of the ‘111 Patent recite inventive concepts that improve 
the functioning of software applications on client devices, particularly web pages running on web 
servers the contents of which are accessed by a request from a client device. 
21. Moreover, the claims of the ‘111 Patent recite inventive concepts that are not 
merely routine or conventional use of networking techniques.  Instead, the patented invention 
disclosed in the ‘111 Patent provides a new and novel solution to specific problems related to 
improving the transmission of information over computer networks in view of the constraints of 
the transmission network.  
22. And finally, the patented invention disclosed in the ‘111 Patent does not preempt 
all the ways that applets may be used to improve the transmission of web page information, nor 
does the ‘111 Patent preempt any other well-known or prior art technology.   
23. Accordingly, the claims in the ‘111 Patent recite a combination of elements 
sufficient to ensure that the claim in substance and in practice amounts to significantly more than 
a patent-ineligible abstract idea. 
Prior Litigation 
24. The ’111 Patent was previously litigated in this District (6-09-cv-00154; 6-10-cv-
00111; 6-10-cv-00112; 6-10-cv-00275; 6-10-cv-00474; 6-10-cv-00491; 6-10-cv-00506; 6-11-cv-

Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (2012-1227; 2015-1681; 2016-1944) (collectively “Prior 
Litigation”). 
25.  The scope and construction of the claims of the ’111 Patent have been clarified 
by the Prior Litigation.   
COUNT I – INFRINGEMENT OF U.S. PATENT NO. 6,446,111 
26. The allegations set forth in the foregoing paragraphs 1 through 25 are 
incorporated into this First Claim for Relief. 
27. On September 3, 2002, the ’111 Patent was duly and legally issued by the United 
States Patent and Trademark Office under the title “Method and apparatus for client-server 
communication using a limited capability client over a low-speed communications link[.]”  A 
true and correct copy of the ’111 Patent is attached as Exhibit A. 
28. DYNAMIC is the assignee and owner of the right, title and interest in and to the 
’111 Patent, including the right to assert all causes of action arising under said patent and the 
right to any remedies for infringement of it.   
29. Upon information and belief, the Defendant has and continues to directly infringe 
one or more claims of the ’111 Patent by making, using, and/or providing and causing to be used 
products, specifically one or more web pages that utilized executable applets, which by way of 
example include https://www.hollisterco.com/shop/wd (the “Accused Instrumentalities”). 
30. Upon information and belief, Defendant has directly infringed at least claim 17 of 
the ‘111 Patent by making, using, and/or providing and causing to be used one or more 
computers or servers that transmit information utilizing one or more executable applets.  
Collectively, the computers or servers are referred to herein as the “Accused Instrumentality”.   
Case 4:17-cv-00878-ALM-KPJ   Document 1   Filed 12/20/17   Page 9 of 16 PageID #:  9
Page 10 of 16 
 
31. Upon information and belief, the Accused Instrumentality performs a method for 
processing data. 
32. Upon information and belief, the Accused Instrumentality includes a website such 
as ‘https://www.hollisterco.com/shop/wd’ that is hosted on a server that is coupled to a 
communications link (e.g., the Internet) and is operable to receive a request from a client device 
(e.g., a computer) accessing the website. 
33. Upon information and belief, the server collects a plurality of data items, e.g., data 
necessary to generate a web page including data necessary to respond to the specific client 
request.  One non-limiting example of a plurality of data items collected as a function of the 
request is the information collected in response to the client’s request for the web page 
‘https://www.hollisterco.com/shop/wd/p/long-sleeve-t-shirt-dress-
10279232?categoryId=12600&seq=01&ofp=true’. This specific information includes data items 
such as ‘Long-Sleeve T-Shirt Dress’, ‘188175_04’, ‘A sporty T-shirt dress made with supersoft 
knit fabric, featuring a crew neckline and stripes, Imported’, ‘Online Exclusive’, ‘S’, etc. 
referenced from line #3987 - line #4116 in Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1). 
34. Upon information and belief, an executable applet is dynamically generated in 
specific response to the request, e.g., by selecting data responsive to the request. For example, 
one or more applets are returned by the Accused Instrumentality (that can include existing code 
and prewritten procedures) that are suitable for execution on the client. One non-limiting 
example of an executable applet is the program code that can be used by a client device, which is 
JSON code, referenced from line #3987 - line #4116 in Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister 
Exhibit 1) which is constructed at the server by combining the requisite functionality with the 
necessary data at the time of and in response to the client request. The requisite functionality is 
Case 4:17-cv-00878-ALM-KPJ   Document 1   Filed 12/20/17   Page 10 of 16 PageID #:  10
Page 11 of 16 
 
present in the form of attributes such as ‘name’, ‘prodImg’, ‘longDesc’, ‘shortDesc’ and 
‘OFPModelSize’ (Hollister Exhibit 1: line #3987 - line #4116) corresponding to the data items 
present in the program code referenced from line #3987 - line #4116 in Hollister’s Source Code 
(Hollister Exhibit 1). The functionality provided by the JSON is providing the client device with 
the ability to read, write, and/or modify the data associated in the attributes. See the limitations 
discussed below. The JSON code can be requested both in a web browser and outside a web 
browser using command line software and can execute on the client device (see, e.g., Hollister 
Exhibit 2). 
35. Upon information and belief, the one or more applets returned by the Accused 
Instrumentality have an associated constituent system comprising a subset of data items which is 
included in the response to the client request as data retrieved as a function of the request. One 
non-limiting example is the subset of data items such as ‘Long-Sleeve T-Shirt Dress’, 
‘188175_04’, ‘A sporty T-shirt dress made with supersoft knit fabric, featuring a crew neckline 
and stripes, Imported’, ‘Online Exclusive’, ‘S’, etc. referenced from line #3987 - line #4116 in 
Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1), that is incorporated and utilized by the program 
code for further operations. At least one data item in the applet is a preloaded value. One non-
limiting example is the subset of data items such as ‘Long-Sleeve T-Shirt Dress’, ‘188175_04’, 
‘A sporty T-shirt dress made with supersoft knit fabric, featuring a crew neckline and stripes, 
Imported’, ‘Online Exclusive’, ‘S’, etc. referenced from line #3987 - line #4116 in Hollister’s 
Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1). 
36. Upon information and belief, the Accused Instrumentality has a further 
constituent system associated with the applet having a data interface capability configured as 
required by this claim element. The program code referenced from line #3987 - line #4116 in 
Case 4:17-cv-00878-ALM-KPJ   Document 1   Filed 12/20/17   Page 11 of 16 PageID #:  11
Page 12 of 16 
 
Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1) comprises attributes such as ‘name’, ‘prodImg’, 
‘longDesc’, ‘shortDesc’ and ‘OFPModelSize’ (Hollister Exhibit 1: line #3987 - line #4116) that 
provide data interface capability by allowing the client to access and use data such as  ‘Long-
Sleeve T-Shirt Dress’, ‘188175_04’, ‘A sporty T-shirt dress made with supersoft knit fabric, 
featuring a crew neckline and stripes, Imported’, ‘Online Exclusive’, ‘S’, etc. referenced from 
line #3987 - line #4116 in Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1). Furthermore, the 
program code is configured to provide a plurality of operations on the preloaded values because 
it allows the client device to read, write and/or modify the data referenced from line #3987 - line 
#4116 in Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1). 
37. Upon information and belief, the program code provides operations associated 
with the subset of the data items because it allows the client device to read, write, and/or modify 
the data in the attributes in the dynamic program code referenced from line #3987 - line #4116 in 
Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1). 
38. Upon information and belief, the applet is operable to be transferred to the client 
device. The above identified code in Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1) is to be sent 
by the server over the Internet and received by the client device. One non-limiting example is 
executable program code dynamically constructed at the server which can be referenced from 
line #3987 - line #4116 in Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1), that is transferred in a 
single transmission over a communications link to the client device. 
39. The Accused Instrumentality infringed and continues to infringe claim 17 of the 
‘111 Patent during the pendency of the ‘111 Patent. 
40. Claim 22 of the ‘111 Patent recites a method of processing data according to 
claim 17, wherein the communications link comprises a wireless link.

featuring a crew neckline and stripes, Imported’, ‘Online Exclusive’, ‘S’, etc. referenced from 
line #3987 - line #4116 in Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1). Furthermore, the 
program code is configured to provide a plurality of operations on the preloaded values because 
it allows the client device to read, write and/or modify the data referenced from line #3987 - line 
#4116 in Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1). These pre-loaded values are non-
updateable. 
46. The Accused Instrumentality infringed and continues to infringe claim 23 of the 
‘111 Patent during the pendency of the ‘111 Patent. 
47. Claim 26 of the ‘111 Patent recites a method according to claim 17, wherein the 
pre-loaded values are non-updateable. 
48. Upon information and belief, the one or more of the executable applets includes 
pre-loaded values which are non-updateable. One non-limiting example is the subset of data 
items such as ‘Long-Sleeve T-Shirt Dress’, ‘188175_04’, ‘A sporty T-shirt dress made with 
supersoft knit fabric, featuring a crew neckline and stripes, Imported’, ‘Online Exclusive’, ‘S’, 
etc. referenced from line #3987 - line #4116 in Hollister’s Source Code (Hollister Exhibit 1). 
49. The Accused Instrumentality infringed and continues to infringe claim 26 of the 
‘111 Patent during the pendency of the ‘111 Patent. 
50. Upon information and belief, since at least the time of receiving this Complaint, 
the Defendant has induced and continues to induce others to infringe at least claims 17, 22, 23, 
and 26 of the ’111 Patent under 35 U.S.C. § 271(b) by, among other things, and with specific
