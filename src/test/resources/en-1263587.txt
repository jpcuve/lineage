II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
3. This action arises under the patent laws of the United States, Title 35 of 
the United States Code. The Court's jurisdiction over this action is proper under the 
above statutes, including 35 U.S.C. § 271 et seq. and 28 U.S.C. § 1338. 
4. Personal jurisdiction exists generally over Defendants pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. § 1391 because they have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum as a 
result of business conducted within the State of Texas and within this district. 
Personal jurisdiction also exists specifically over Defendants because of Defendants' 
conduct in making, using, selling, offering to sell, and/or importing, directly, 
contributory, and/or by inducement, infringing products and services within the State 
of Texas and within this district. In particular, Defendants have provided services and 
sold products in this District for other infringing companies which are or were 
Defendants in related pending litigation the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of Texas. 
5. Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. §§1391 (b), (c), and (d), 
as well as 28 U.S.C., § 1400(b). Furthermore, Defendants are related business

groups operating in conjunction with First Data Corporation, a defendant in litigation 
involving the same patents currently pending in this District. These Defendants 
operate in such a fashion that they are the alter ego of First Data Corporation, 
sharing liability and responsibility for the acts of infringement that all the related 
companies have engaged in. As First Data Corporation has admitted that venue 
over it is proper in the Eastern District of Texas, venue and jurisdiction are likewise 
proper over the present Defendants, as the facts of infringement underlying all 
Defendants are overlapping and responsibility for said actions is joint. 
Ill. PATENT INFRINGMENT 
6. Data Treasury is the owner as assignee of all rights, title and interest in 
and under United States Patent No. 5,910,988 ("the '988 patent"), which duly and 
legally issued on June 8, 1999, with Claudio Ballard as the named inventor, for an 
invention in remote image capture with centralized processing and storage. 
7. Data Treasury is the owner as assignee of all rights, title, and interest in 
and under United States Patent No. 6,032, 137 ("the '137 patent"), which duly and 
legally issued on February 29, 2000, with Claudio Ballard as the named inventor, for 
an invention in a remote image capture with centralized processing and storage. 
8. Defendants have been and are infringing the '988 and '137 patents by 
making, using, selling, offering for sale, and/or importing in or into the United States, 
directly, contributory, and/or by inducement, without authority, products and services 
that fall within the scope of the claims of the '988 and '137 patents, unless enjoined 
by this Court. Data Treasury is without an adequate remedy at law.

the infringement of the '988 and '137 patents among themselves and by others.
