Case 6:06-cv-00252-LED   Document 1    Filed 06/08/06   Page 2 of 7 PageID #:  2
may be found and/or resides in this judicial district. Such events include, inter alia, USA 
Scientific's sale and arrangement for sale of infringing products throughout the State of Texas 
and in this judicial district. USA Scientific regularly and deliberately places infringing products 
in the stream of commerce with the knowledge and intent that these infringing products will be 
used, sold, or offered for sale in the State of Texas and in this judicial district. 
FACTS 
5. Rainin is dedicated to the development, manufacture, and distribution of the 
world's most advanced pipetting products and services. Rainin is a leading provider of 
ergonomic and traditional pipettes and pipette tips, and holds numerous patents relating to those 
products. 
6. On January 2, 200 I, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S. 
Patent No. 6,168,761, entitled "Pipette with Improved Pipette Tip and Mounting Shaft" (the 
'"761 Patent"), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A. 
7. On January 9, 2001, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S. 
Patent No. 6,171,553, entitled "Pipette with Improved Pipette Tip and Mounting Shaft" (the 
"'553 Patent"), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit B. 
8. Since their issuance, the '761 and '553 Patents have been in full force and effect. 
Rainin is the owner of the entire right, title, and interest in and to the '761 and '553 Patents, 
including the right to sue for infringement thereof, by assignment from the assignee-at-issue, 
Rainin Instrument Co., Inc. 
9. Rainin has sold and/or sells pipettes and pipette tips that individually or in 
combination embody the inventions claimed in the '761 and '553 Patents under the name 
"L TS™". The L TS™ pipette-tip combination supplies a reliable seal with a substantial 
reduction in the force required for a user to mount and eject the pipette tip on and from the 
mounting shaft of the pipette, as well as excellent resistance to transverse rocking or dislodging 
of the pipette tip on the mounting shaft that might otherwise occur during "touching off' of the 
pipette tip by a user when dispensing liquid. The reduced forces provided by the inventions of

Case 6:06-cv-00252-LED   Document 1    Filed 06/08/06   Page 3 of 7 PageID #:  3
the '761 and '553 Patents minimize the risks of repetitive pipetting-related hand stress and 
injuries to pipette users. 
10. On information and belief, Defendant USA Scientific designs, manufactures, and 
markets pipette tips, including tips marketed under the name "TipOne® L," that are specifically 
designed and marketed for use with Rainin LTS™ pipettes. For example, on the USA Scientific 
website, USA Scientific markets its TipOne® L tips as follows: 
Break free from locked-in consumables! TipOne® Lis guaranteed to fit 
your Rainin® LiteTouch™ pipettors. Now you can have TipOne® quality 
and convenience for all the pipettors in your lab, including the light force 
LTS™brand. 
11. Rainin notified USA Scientific that USA Scientific's marketing and sales of its 
TipOne® L tips constitute infringement, inducing infringement, and/or contributory 
infringement of the '761 and '553 Patents. 
FIRST COUNT 
(Patent Infringement- U.S. Patent No. 6,168,761) 
12. Rainin incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 11 of this Complaint and 
realleges them as though fully set forth herein. 
13. USA Scientific has infringed and is continuing to infringe the '761 Patent in 
violation of35 U.S.C. § 271(a) by engaging in acts that include making, using, offering to sell, 
and/or selling within the United States, and/or importing into the United States, pipette tips 
incorporating the patented invention described and claimed in the '761 Patent. These products 
include USA Scientific's TipOne® L pipette tips. 
14. USA Scientific actively and knowingly induces infringement of the '761 Patent 
within the United States in violation of35·U.S.C. § 271(b) by causing third parties to practice the 
invention claimed in the '761 Patent within the United States, in connection with USA 
Scientific's advertising, marketing, sales, distribution, and information dissemination concerning 
its TipOne® L pipette tips.

Case 6:06-cv-00252-LED   Document 1    Filed 06/08/06   Page 4 of 7 PageID #:  4
15. USA Scientific knowingly contributes to the infringement of the '761 Patent by 
selling and/or offering to sell within the United States TipOne® L pipette tips, which are a 
material part of practicing the invention claimed in the '761 Patent. USA Scientific knows that 
the TipOne® L pipette tips are especially made or adapted for use in the infringement of the '761 
Patent and are not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial 
noninfringing use. 
16. Third parties directly infringe the '761 Patent by using USA Scientific TipOne® 
L pipette tips that are manufactured, marketed, and/or sold by USA Scientific to practice the 
invention claimed in the '761 Patent. 
17. USA Scientific is aware that such third parties thereby directly infringe the '761 
Patent. 
18. The activities of USA Scientific have been without express or implied license 
from Rainin. 
19. USA Scientific will continue to infringe the '761 Patent unless enjoined by this 
Court. As a result of the infringing conduct of USA Scientific, Rainin has suffered and will 
continue to suffer irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, 
Raininis entitled to temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief against such 
infringement pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 283 and under traditional principles of equity. 
20. As a result of the infringement of the '761 Patent by USA Scientific, Rainin has 
been damaged and will be damaged further, and is entitled to be compensated for such damages 
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 284 in an amount that cannot presently be ascertained, but that will be 
determined at trial. Rainin is entitled to recover damages adequate to compensate it for the 
infringement complained of herein, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty. 
21. On information and belief, USA Scientific's past and continuing infringement of 
the '761 Patent has been deliberate and willful, and this case is therefore an exceptional case, 
which warrants an award of treble damages and attorneys' fees to Rainin in accordance with 35 
U.S.C. §§ 284 and 285.
