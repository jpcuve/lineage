COUNT I 
INFRINGEMENT OF U.S. PATENT NO. 8,195,569 
9. Plaintiff is the owner by assignment of United States Patent No. 8,195,569 (“the 
’569 Patent”) titled “E-bazaar featuring personal information security.”  The ’569 Patent issued 
on June 5, 2012.  A true and correct copy of the ’569 Patent is attached as Exhibit A.  
10. Upon information and belief, each Defendant has been and is now infringing the 
’569  Patent in the State of Texas, in this judicial district, and elsewhere in the United States, by, 
among other things, directly or through intermediaries, making, using, importing, providing, 
supplying, distributing, selling, and/or offering for sale apparatuses and systems practiced on 
Defendants’ website (including, without limitation, www.godaddy.com and its auction services 
and related internal systems supporting the operation of said websites) providing an electronic 
bazaar, an advertiser client and a buyer client, both configured to send one or more items of 
personal information, a product database, and an electronic broker that provides trusted 
processing of transactions, ensuring that the rules governing the buyers and sellers personal 
information are satisfied, covered by one or more claims of the ’569 Patent to the injury of 
CYVA.  Defendants are directly infringing, literally infringing, and/or infringing the ’569 Patent 
under the doctrine of equivalents.  Defendants are thus liable for infringement of the ’569 Patent 
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 271.   
Case 2:15-cv-00385-JRG   Document 1   Filed 03/17/15   Page 3 of 5 PageID #:  3
11. Upon information and belief, to the extent any marking was required by 35 U.S.C. 
§ 287, all predecessors in interest to the ’569 Patent complied with any such requirements. 
12. As a result of Defendants’ infringement of the ’569 Patent, Plaintiff has suffered 
monetary damages and is entitled to a money judgment in an amount adequate to compensate for 
Defendants’ infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the 
invention by Defendants, together with interest and costs as fixed by the court, and Plaintiff will 
continue to suffer damages in the future unless Defendants’ infringing activities are enjoined by 
this Court. 
13. Unless a permanent injunction is issued enjoining Defendants and their agents, 
servants, employees, representatives, affiliates, and all others acting on in active concert 
therewith from infringing the ’569 Patent, Plaintiff will be greatly and irreparably harmed. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter: 
1. A judgment in favor of Plaintiff that Defendants have infringed the’569 Patent; 
2. A permanent injunction enjoining Defendants and their officers, directors, agents 
servants, affiliates, employees, divisions, branches, subsidiaries, parents, and all others acting in 
active concert therewith from infringement, inducing the infringement of, or contributing to the 
infringement of the ’569 Patent, or such other equitable relief the Court determines is warranted; 
3. A judgment and order requiring Defendants pay to Plaintiff its damages, costs, 
expenses, and prejudgment and post-judgment interest for Defendants’ infringement of the ’569 
Patent as provided under 35 U.S.C. § 284, and an accounting of ongoing post-judgment 
infringement; and 
Case 2:15-cv-00385-JRG   Document 1   Filed 03/17/15   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  4
4. Any and all other relief, at law or equity, to which Plaintiff may show itself to be 
entitled. 
DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
